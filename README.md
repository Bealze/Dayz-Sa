# Dayz-Sa

4 class's of players. Players respawn with a completely random loadout EVERY time.
Adjust your array items to whatever you prefer, just keep in mind inventory space.


## Getting Started
   ## Skip if server installed
These instructions will get  up and running on your local machine.
Even if you dont have the server installed yet.
locate the Dayz-updater-Installer.bat open with notepad++ edit the required sections.
Save it then run it and wait untile its finished.
Will need steam cmd installed for this to work as well.
